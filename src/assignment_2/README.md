PPA Assignment 2

This coursework is designed to test the content from Topics 1, 2, 3 and 4.

For this week's assessment, consider the following scenario, and then complete the tasks that follow it:

A person wishes to track their total calorie intake. This total is affected by two things: eating and walking. In addition, they have decided to follow a meal plan, offering a finite selection of meals which they can consume.

1. Model this scenario based on the following requirements:
	1. Create a class to represent a Person. A person has a total number of calories which 	   they have consumed, which starts with zero. (1 mark)
	2. Create a class to represent a Meal, which consists of three things: a starter Dish, a 	   main Dish and a dessert Dish. Each Dish has a number of calories it provides when 		   consumed. (2 marks)
	3. In the class Meal, create a method calculateCalories which returns the total calories 	   in a meal. (1 mark)
	4. A person can eat a meal, which results in the total calories being added to the                	   person's total calories consumed. (1 mark)
	5. A person can burn calories by going for a walk. Assume that this burns calories at 	   the rate of 1 calorie per minute. (1 mark)
2. Create a class CalorieTracker, which can be compiled and run from the command line. Use   this class to do the following (in order), using the functions of your Person class:
	1. Create a person and print their total number of calories. (1 mark)
	2. Use the list of meals from the bottom of the page to complete the following tasks:
		1. Make the person eat the meal with the lowest calories. Then, print the total 			   calories in this meal and print the new total calories of the person. (1 mark)
		2. Make the person eat the meal with 1000 calories. Then, print the total calories 		   in this meal and print the new total calories of the person. (1 mark)
	3. Make the person eat the meal with the highest calories. Then, print the total 			   calories in this meal and print the new total calories of the person. (1 mark)
 
 3. Finally, make your person go for a walk until their total calorie intake reaches 2000. This will require your person to walk for a certain number of minutes. After the walk, print this number of minutes. (1 mark)
